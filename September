What should I really do.
What should I improve and what should I start to learn again?

- Finish Getting Ready For AP Calculus BC
- Study for the SAT(Math Category)
- Keep studying Coding in order to remember how to.
- Find what I want to do, something I can actually keep doing and will sustain me.

I should keep them simple.
Since a lot.
Lot of events are soon to happen here
