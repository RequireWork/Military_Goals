ㅇ I am once again back on the grind.
ㅇ I was constantly going through training and practices during the past few days.
ㅇ The Computer Lab also had to go through maintenance so I had a bit of a pause and finally came back to refresh my studying on coding once again.
ㅇ For a bit few days I was actually studying Mathematics through Khan academy(Linear Algebra)

Here are my goals for July and August
ㅇ Finish C coding on Codeacademy
ㅇ Successfully get through 50% on Python learning
ㅇ Finish Linear Algebra on Khan Academy and take a few tests on it.
ㅇ Update my LinkedIn profile
ㅇ Try to start a Project(Starting a project in C is hard in military. The PC here are made before 2016...)

Hopefully I can get through them!
(Here are some previous goals during June to add on.)
