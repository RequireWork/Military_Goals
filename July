[07.14]

ã…‡ I am once again back on the grind.
ã…‡ I was constantly going through training and practices during the past few days.
ã…‡ The Computer Lab also had to go through maintenance so I had a bit of a pause and finally came back to refresh my studying on coding once again.
ã…‡ For a bit few days I was actually studying Mathematics through Khan academy(Linear Algebra)

Here are my goals for July and August
ã…‡ Finish C coding on Codeacademy
ã…‡ Successfully get through 50% on Python learning
ã…‡ Finish Linear Algebra on Khan Academy and take a few tests on it.
ã…‡ Update my LinkedIn profile
ã…‡ Try to start a Project(Starting a project in C is hard in military. The PC here are made before 2016...)

Hopefully I can get through them!

ðŸ‘€(Here are some previous goals during June to add on.)ðŸ‘€
- Successfully Create a Pico-8 Game -> Gonna Attempt this on July!
- Build a Project in C -> Gonna put this as the last on the July list as I want to test a few other languages to see which one can actually run well.
- Finish The Computer Science Course -> This is the 50% Python Learning Goal during July!
- Start off with some Cyber Security at the mean time and get the basics started -> Definitely going after I finish C coding!
